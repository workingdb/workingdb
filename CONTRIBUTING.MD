	```
2. Commit / Push to your branch (NOT Master)
   This is the same as the Bash comand:
	```bash

	```

#### Release Changes to Production Repository
1. AFTER PUSH, switch to master branch
   This is the same as the Bash comand:
	```bash
	git checkout master
	```
2. Merge your branch
   This is the same as the Bash comand:
	```bash
	git merge branch-name
	```
3. "Push" to make changes public in GitHub
      This is the same as the Bash comand:
	```bash
	git push origin master
	```
4. Publish (Pull) down in production location to actually change the production front end
   This is the same as the Bash comand (in production repository):
	```bash
	git pull origin master
	```
